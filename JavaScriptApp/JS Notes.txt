Scripts folder contains the JS code and files related to JS. It might include libraries like jQuery, BootStrap and other JS libs. 
Views contain UR HTML Pages that is to be displayed to the Users.All HTML docs will come in the Views. 
Content folder will contain the CSS files required for UR application.

JS is case sensitive. UR variables are declared as var, (let and const are new from ES6). 
Names of UR variables should be camel cased, U could use sp symbols like _ and $.
; is optional in JS. It is good to end a statement with ;. 
If U R writing multiple statements in one line, then ; must be be required to separate each statement. 
Statements: if...else, switch, do...while, while, for, foreach, for in.
U can create JS code either within the HTML doc or U could create it in a seperate file with extension .js.
JS code will execute on browsers only. U dont have a compiler for JS, its a scripting language, U need an interpretor. HTML pages run on the browser. So always embedd the js code inside an HTML document and run it.
NODE.js is the way of running JS code outside the browser. 
JS has got a lot of functions that can be used in ur js code. 
UI related: alert, prompt, confirm. 
With new JS, it is wrong to use undeclared variables. U should declare them before use.
When U declare a variable, but dont initialize it, it is called undefined. 
JS does not have data type for the user, internally it has 4 types: number, string, bool, object.
To display ur info within the browser but not on the document, U could use console.log. This is helpful for debugging purpose and will not corrupt the User interface.
